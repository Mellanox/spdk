This provides test vectors for the 128-bit AES-XTS encryption verification.

**General File Information
The following describes the files under the oci-blockstorage-aes-xts-128-test-vectors directory.

aes-xts-keys - This file contains the encryption keys used in the test vector. There are three pairs.
aes-test-vector-data* - These data files contain the input data used for encryption. There are three of them.
aes-xts-encrypted-outputs - This folder contains the encrypted output for your comparison.

Here is the description of the encrypted output file format under aes-xts-encrypted-outputs directory. An example below:

aes-kp1-data1-lba136-sz4096-encrypted-output

kp* - This indicates the key pairs used. The kp1 is the first key pair in the aes-xts-keys file, kp2 is the second pair, and so on.
data* - This indicates the input data used. The data1 is aes-test-vector-data-1, data2 is aes-test-vector-data-2, and so on.
lba* - This is the lba that needs to be used to calculate the tweak value. The block size is 512.
sz* - It is the size of the encrypted data. The 4096 is the output of the encrypted input data file, which is 4096 bytes. The 1536 is the output of the encryption of the first 1536 bytes of the input data file.

**LBA Used
4096 size - 0, 24, 56, 136, 838860, 20971520, 62914560
1536 size - 1623, 1638, 1653, 1668

**Test Vectors Provided
There are 63 encrypted output provided for size 4096 --> 3 keys * 3 data inputs * 7 lbas = 63.
There are 36 encrypted output provided for size 1536 --> 3 keys * 3 data inputs * 4 lbas = 36
Total encrypted output provided is 99 (63 + 66)
